## Summary

This is my 1st time programming an app and I learned so much in the process.  While building this digital clock app I learned how to use functions in lexical and global scope, converting long strings into shorter more legible string themes and using multiple avenues of logic to return parameters to the DOM.  I really like the idea of clean code and it's a great feeling to look over your code when it's finished.  I can't wait to learn more and continue building more projects!
